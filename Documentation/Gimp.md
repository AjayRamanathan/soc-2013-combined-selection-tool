#Introduction

[Gimp][0] is an open source softwaree for high-end image processing. For the image editing there are seven different selection tools available.My Project is to turn the seven selection tools into fewer more compact set of tools. The new set of tools should have to be musch faster/easier to use than the old ones.For example, the user shouldn't have to go out of the image in the menu bar to change the options. It also must be easy to user for all users.And the new tool need to have adequate shortcuts.

#My Project

**Implementation of the combined selection tool** :
This project aim is to implement a unified selection tool that combines the functionality of the rectangle/ellipse selection tool, fuzzy select, select by color, foreground selection tool, free selection tool and intelligent scissors into three new tools, and is easier and faster to use.
